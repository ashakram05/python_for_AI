# 🐍 Basic Python Programs

## 📚 Overview  
This folder contains fundamental Python programs that help in understanding basic programming concepts. Each script is simple and beginner-friendly.

### 📂 List of Programs  
1. **Palindrome Checker** - Checks whether a number or string is a palindrome.
2. **Reverse a Number** - Reverses the digits of a given number.
3. **Factorial Calculator** - Computes the factorial of a given number.

## 🚀 1. Palindrome Checker  
### 🔹 Description  
A **palindrome** is a word, number, or sequence that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., `121`, `madam`). This program checks if the user input is a palindrome.

### 🔹 How It Works  
- Takes input from the user.  
- Reverses it and compares it with the original.  
- Prints whether it is a palindrome.  

### 🔹 Example  
```python
Enter a number or string: racecar
Output: racecar is a palindrome!
```

📂 **File:** `palindrome.py`

## 🔄 2. Reverse a Number  
### 🔹 Description  
This program takes an integer input and reverses its digits.

### 🔹 How It Works  
- Takes an integer as input.  
- Uses string slicing or mathematical operations to reverse it.  
- Displays the reversed number.  

### 🔹 Example  
```python
Enter a number: 1234
Output: Reversed number: 4321
```

## ⚙️ 3. Factorial Calculator  
### 🔹 Description  
The **factorial** of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers up to `n` (e.g., `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`). This program calculates the factorial of a given number.

### 🔹 How It Works  
- Takes an integer as input.  
- Uses recursion or a loop to compute the factorial.  
- Displays the calculated factorial.  

### 🔹 Example  
```python
Enter a number: 5
Output: A factorial of 5 is 120
```

📂 **File:** `factorial_of_number.py`
